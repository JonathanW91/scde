# Spectral Correlation Density Estimation

This is a collection of Matlab/Octave scripts I implemented as part of my PhD
work. There are functions that implement common spectral estimators such as the
CAPON and APES estimators. There are also small experiments to generate OFDM,
BPSK, QAM signals and some utilities to obtain hankel matrices, correlation
matrices, etc. Refer to each file for more details on what they do.

The files with *_test* in their name are simple test cases to validate the other
scripts. The *powerspectra* and *res_* scripts are those I used to generate
graphs for my papers.

The paper folder contains one publication I wrote using these scripts. You may
refer to the references within there to understand better how these scripts
were implemented and how they work.

## Disclaimer

I recently found these files deep in my old hard disk while doing some cleanup.
I have no guarantees on the correctness of these scripts and I have long forgotten
how they work. Please use at your own risk and don't ask me how to use them
because I most likely won't remember.

## License

For all scripts implemented by me the MIT license applies. Other scripts may
belong to others so please refer to the license included on those scripts.
